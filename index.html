<h3> Tulip</h3>
<h4 id="h4">Take a square shapes paper or origami paper.
<br>
Make two folds right on the middle of the paper, horizontally and vertically.
<br>
Then rotate the paper and fold it diagonally right in the middle. Horizontally and vertically.
<br>
Hold the both left and right points of the paper and gently push them towards the center.
<br>
The paper will automatically fold according to the previous fold.
<br>
Then it'll take a triangular shape.
<br>
Fold the top left corner to the bottom point.
<br>
Similarly fold the top right corner to the bottom point.
<br>
Now flip the piece and do the same method on this side as well.
<br>
Fold the right side over the left side.
<br>
Also do this same method on the opposite side as well.
<br>
Now bring the left flap towards the center and fold it along the vertical crease on the middle.
<br>
Do the same on the right side.
<br>
Open up the middle of the left flap.
<br>
Then insert the right flap into the middle of the left flap. Glue it there to secure the fold.
<br>
Do the same on the other side as well.
<br>
Detect the hole on the bottom of the tulip.
<br>
Blow some air into that hole to inflate the flower to bring it to it's shape.
<br>
Now spread the petals of the tulip to finish it up.
<br>
Use the template to cut out the leaves and stem for the flower.
<br>
Take a green piece of paper about 6 inches long and 2 inches width. Roll the paper into a stick.
<br>
Then glue leaves on the stick then insert the green stick through the bottom hole of the tulip.
<br>
And there you go.... It's ready.
<br>
Enjoy!

<h3>Butterfly</h3>

Fold the square of paper in half so that the corners meet up and you form a triangle. 
<br>
Open up the paper and repeat with the other 2 corners. 
<br>
Then open up the square and TURN IT OVER.
<br>
Now fold the square in half again but this time bring 2 opposite sides together so that you form a rectangle.
<br>
Open up the square and repeat with the other 2 sides. Your square of paper should look like this.
<br>
Now use the folds you have made to fold up the square to form a triangle. 
<br>
The square should naturally fold up to form this shape because of your folding. 
<br>
If it does not check that you turned your square over between folds as described above.
